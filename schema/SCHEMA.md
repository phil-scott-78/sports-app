# Normalized sports schema

> The canonical data model every screen is built on. Designed from **live ESPN
> responses verified June 2026** and hardened by an adversarial verification pass
> (which caught ~30 hallucinated ids / wrong status names / bad field paths — see
> `.research-digest.md` for the raw evidence).
>
> Three files, one contract:
> - **`canonical.ts`** — the canonical types the normalizers emit and the UI consumes.
> - **`league-profiles.json`** — the data-driven league registry (inheritance).
> - **`SCHEMA.md`** (this) — how they fit, the mappings, the quirks, examples.
>
> **Note on producer:** this doc predates `drop-the-worker.md` and still says
> "the worker" and names `/v1/…` routes + `worker/src/*.js`. The **canonical shape
> is unchanged** — only the producer moved: the normalizers now run **on-device**
> in `app/lib/src/data/` (faithful Dart ports of those same `worker/src/*.js`,
> which survive as the golden-parity oracle). Read "the worker emits X on `/v1/Y`"
> as "the app builds X via `api.dart`'s `Y(...)`". ESPN→canonical mappings + quirks
> below are all still accurate.

## 1. The three-layer model

You asked for "a generic format for all sports, then a generalized baseball one,
then inherited NBA/WNBA/CBB/WCBB-style differences." That's exactly the shape:

```
                ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   LAYER 1      │  Universal contract (canonical.ts)        │
   the shape    │  Event → Competition → Competitor         │
                │  + 3 discriminators: layout, scoreKind,   │
                │    competitorKind                         │
                └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                  ▲ instantiated by
                ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   LAYER 2      │  Family profiles (league-profiles.json)   │
   the defaults │  soccer · football · basketball · baseball│
                │  hockey · tennis · golf · racing · mma ·  │
                │  cricket · rugby · rugby-league           │
                │  → period unit, OT model, score kind,     │
                │    where edge data lives                  │
                └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                  ▲ extends
                ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   LAYER 3      │  League overrides (league-profiles.json)  │
   the deltas   │  nba(4×12) wnba(4×10) ncaam(2×20)         │
                │  ncaaw(4×10) · mlb(9) softball(7) ·       │
                │  champions-tour(3 rounds) · …             │
                │  → only the fields that differ + the      │
                │    VERIFIED league id                     │
                └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Layer 1 is **types** (rarely changes). Layers 2–3 are **data** — adding a league
is a JSON entry, never new code. A league resolves by walking its `extends`
chain (`basketball/nba → basketball`), nearest value wins.

**Why discriminators instead of a class-per-sport hierarchy:** the client and
worker stay simple (one `Competition` renderer, one parser switch) and the wire
format is uniform/cacheable. The "inheritance" lives in the profile data, where
it belongs, not in a type tree you'd have to redeploy to extend.

### The canonical basketball example (the one you flagged)

| League | `periodUnit` | `regulation` | `lengthMin` | id | ranking |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `basketball/nba`   | quarter | 4 | **12** | 46 | none |
| `basketball/wnba`  | quarter | 4 | **10** | 59 | none |
| `basketball/mens-college-basketball`   | **half** | **2** | **20** | 41 | curatedRank |
| `basketball/womens-college-basketball` | quarter | 4 | **10** | 54 | curatedRank |

All four `extends: "basketball"` and inherit `scoreKind:numeric`,
`layout:headToHead`, `competitorKind:team`, 5-min unlimited OT, and OT detection
by `period > regulation`. They override only unit/count/length/id/ranking.
NCAAW = quarters (since 2015-16) was the single most error-prone assumption;
**verified true against the 2025 title game** (4 linescores, status.period=4).

---

## 2. Reading a competition (the discriminator decision table)

A consumer never special-cases by sport name. It reads three flags:

| `layout` | `scoreKind` | `competitorKind` | Examples | How to render |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| headToHead | numeric | team | soccer, football, basketball, baseball, hockey, rugby | 2 sides, big score, home/away |
| headToHead | numeric | athlete | tennis | 2 players, set scores; **ignore homeAway** |
| headToHead | cricket | team | cricket | 2 sides, composite score string |
| headToHead | none | athlete | MMA bout | 2 fighters, winner+method, no score |
| field | toPar | athlete/pair | golf | leaderboard, to-par, sorted by `order` |
| field | none | athlete | racing | grid, sorted by `order`, no score |

`competitorKind: 'pair'` (tennis/golf doubles) carries `athletes[2]`; everything
else carries `athletes[1]` (athlete) or team identity (team).

### 2a. Capability flags (`capabilities{}`) — the render-or-hide gate

The three discriminators pick the *renderer*; they do **not** say which optional
datum a sport actually serves. That is the `capabilities{}` object on each
**family** in `league-profiles.json`, resolved through the same `extends` chain
as everything else (objects shallow-merge, so a league override **adds** flags
without restating the family's — e.g. `basketball/mens-college-basketball` adds
`hasSeeds` on top of the basketball family's four). **Omit-means-false:** read
`capabilities.flag == true` and hide the element cleanly otherwise — never an
empty chip. Every flag below was verified against observed presence in
`schema/espn-guide/` (crawl 2026-07-08), not documentation.

| Flag | True for (families; + league overrides) | Gates | Evidence (espn-guide) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hasSummaryTier` | all except golf / mma / racing / tennis | Box / Plays / Stats chips; the whole rich detail | summary endpoint `—` (404) for exactly those four sports |
| `hasSituation` | baseball, basketball | bases/count/outs, bonus — the cheap live glance | scoreboard `competitions[].situation` observed only for those two |
| `hasWinProb` | baseball, basketball, football | the win-probability bar | summary `winprobability[]` |
| `hasScoringPlaysArray` | football | the `scoringPlays[]` feed shape (others derive from `plays[]`/`keyEvents[]`) | summary `scoringPlays[]` football-only |
| `hasPlaysFeed` | australian-football, baseball, basketball, hockey | dense play-by-play tab | summary `plays[]` |
| `hasCommentary` | soccer, cricket | soccer narrative / cricket ball-by-ball | soccer: summary `commentary[]`; cricket: summary `header.competitions[].commentaries.{key}` (different path, same gate) |
| `hasForm` | soccer, rugby, rugby-league | the `WLWWL` form string | scoreboard `competitors[].form` |
| `hasPowerPlay` | hockey | PP badge/clock | summary `plays[].strength` (`power-play`/`short-handed`) |
| `hasSeeds` | tennis; + `basketball/{mens,womens}-college-basketball` | bracket seed badges | core `competitors[].tournamentMatchup.seed` (NCAA tournament); tennis groupings `curatedRank` |
| `hasWeather` | baseball, australian-football | weather chip (~1% of events: outdoor + game-day) | scoreboard `events[].weather` |

Two capability-shaped keys **predate** this object and stay top-level (do NOT
duplicate them into `capabilities{}`): **`hasLineScores`** (the per-period grid)
and **`rankingsFeed`** (`polls` / `tour` / `divisions` — the standalone rankings
page). Known tension left as-is: the crawl observed scoreboard `linescores` for
field-hockey and mma where the registry's live-probed `hasLineScores:false`
stands — re-probe before flipping those.

Consumers: JS resolves via `schema/tools/resolve.mjs`; the Dart port exposes
`hasCapability(profile, flag)` in `app/lib/src/data/profiles.dart`.

---

## 3. Universal envelope mapping (ESPN → canonical)

All sports share this spine (verified across soccer/NBA/NFL/MLB/NHL):

| Canonical | ESPN raw path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `event.id` | `events[].id` | string; feeds `summary?event=` |
| `event.start` | `events[].date` | **always UTC `Z`** — always pass explicit `?dates=`, convert locally |
| `competition.competitors[]` | `events[].competitions[0].competitors[]` | `competitions` is an array but ~always length 1 (except F1) |
| `competitor.homeAway` | `…competitors[].homeAway` | meaningless for tennis/MMA |
| `competitor.score.display` | `…competitors[].score` | **a STRING** (`"103"`) |
| `competitor.periodScores[]` | `…competitors[].linescores[]` | `{value:number, displayValue:string, period:int}`; **absent in soccer** |
| `status.phase` | derived from `…status.type.{state,completed,name}` | branch on `name`, not `state` (postponed can read state=`post`) |
| `status.period` | `…status.type`'s `status.period` | raw int, **no unit** — label via profile `periodMap` |
| `season.type` | `events[].season.type` | **open enum**: 1/2/3/4 **and 6=championship-series** |

**Status normalization (one map for all sports):** `state==='in'` → `live`;
`state==='post' && completed` → `final`; otherwise branch on `type.name`
(`STATUS_POSTPONED`/`STATUS_CANCELED`/`STATUS_SUSPENDED`/`STATUS_ABANDONED`/
`STATUS_FORFEIT` → matching `Phase`); unknown name with `pre` → `scheduled`,
else → `unknown` (pass through, never crash).

A single `final` Phase legitimately comes from many names:
`STATUS_FINAL`(3), `STATUS_FULL_TIME`(28), `STATUS_FINAL_AET`(45),
`STATUS_FINAL_PEN`(47), `STATUS_RETIRED`(38).

---

## 4. Period / OT structure — all leagues (the critical matrix)

This is the heart of "dial in all the leagues." `regulation`/`unit` come from
the profile; `played`/`isOvertime` are reconciled with live data.

| League | unit × reg × len | Overtime model | OT signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soccer domestic | half × 2 × 45 | none (draw stands) | n/a — max period 2 |
| Soccer knockout | half × 2 × 45 | AET p4 → pens p5 | period 4/5; `STATUS_FINAL_AET`/`_PEN` |
| NFL | quarter × 4 × 15 | 1 timed period (p5), reg can tie | period>4 / altDetail 'OT' |
| NCAAF | quarter × 4 × 15 | untimed alt-possession, multi-OT, never ties | period>4 (NOT detail string) |
| CFL / UFL | quarter × 4 × 15 | alt-possession, can tie | period>4 |
| NBA | quarter × 4 × 12 | 5-min unlimited | period>4 |
| WNBA / NCAAW | quarter × 4 × 10 | 5-min unlimited | period>4 |
| NCAAM | **half × 2 × 20** | 5-min unlimited | **period>2** |
| MLB / college baseball | inning × 9 × — | extra innings | max(period)>9 → 'Final/11' |
| College softball | **inning × 7 × —** | extra innings | max(period)>7 |
| NHL (reg) | period × 3 × 20 | 3-on-3 OT p4 → **shootout p5** | p4=OT, p5=SO ('Final/SO') |
| NHL (playoff) | period × 3 × 20 | unlimited 20-min, no SO | p5+ = 2OT |
| College hockey | period × 3 × 20 | OT, **ties possible** | p4; W-L-T records |
| Tennis | set × **3 or 5** × — | none (best-of) | **derive best-of from gender+major+singles, NOT format.periods** |
| Golf | round × 4 (or **3** Champions) × — | sudden-death playoff | `status.hadPlayoff` / period>numberOfRounds |
| Racing | lap × 0 × — | none (NASCAR GWC = more laps) | n/a |
| MMA | round × **3 or 5 per bout** × 5 | none | read per-bout `format.periods` |
| Cricket | innings × **2 (limited) or 4 (Test)** | super over → extra periods | read `class.generalClassCard` per match |
| Rugby (union) | half × 2 × 40 | knockout: 2×10 ET + kicks | period>2 |
| Rugby league (NRL) | half × 2 × 40 | golden point 2×5 | period>2; detail 'Final' not 'FT' |
| Australian football (AFL) | quarter × 4 × 20 | rare finals ET | period>4. score=TOTAL points; linescores **non-cumulative** (sum quarters). clock counts **up** (can read >20:00 from time-on) |
| Lacrosse (PLL/NLL/NCAA) | quarter × 4 × 15 | sudden-death OT p5 | period>4; detail 'Final/OT'. linescores **per-period** (sum = total) |
| Volleyball (NCAA/FIVB) | **set × 5 × —** | none (best-of-5) | n/a — `set` not an OT unit; periodScores = per-set points, match score = sets won |
| Water polo (NCAA) | quarter × 4 × 8 | none/ET | period>4 |
| Field hockey (NCAA W) | quarter × 4 × — | OT + penalty strokes | thin feed: no linescores; OT/SO via `status.type.detail` |

---

## 5. Score & outcome mapping (per `scoreKind`)

- **numeric** — `score.value = parseInt(competitors[].score)`. `decision` from
  period/status (regulation/overtime/draw).
- **soccer decorations** — penalty shootout: `shootoutScore` (number). Source
  RECONCILED 2026-07: the normalizer reads a scoreboard `competitor.shootoutScore`
  when present AND the summary carries `gameInfo.*ShootoutScore`; neither could be
  re-verified live in July (no shootout in window) — treat scoreboard as primary,
  gameInfo as the documented fallback (§9 re-check). Winner set from it,
  `decision:'shootout'`, display `"1-1 (4-3 pens)"`. Two-leg: `aggregateScore`
  (**STRING** `"8.0"`) + `advance`, `decision:'aggregate'`.
- **toPar** (golf) — `score.toPar` from `'-10'|'E'|'+3'`; `score.strokes` is
  DERIVED (sum of completed-round linescore values — see normalize.js), no core
  fetch. Non-finishers: VERIFIED 2026-07 **no MC/WD/DQ label survives on any live
  endpoint** (cut players are removed from later-round scoreboards; competitor
  `status` absent) — render the cut LINE from `meta.golf` instead.
- **cricket** — `score.display` is the composite string; real numbers in
  `periodScores[].cricket {runs,wickets,overs,target,reason}`. Winner from
  `meta.cricketSummary`, not run totals. The full scorecard (batting/bowling
  figures) is the summary tier's `cricketInnings` (from `matchcards`).
- **none / racing** — no score. `order`=finish, `startOrder`=grid. DNF = **no
  `order` + sparse stats** (keys absent, not zero). Championship tables come from
  the ordinary standings path (athlete-shaped entries — see §6).
- **none / MMA** — `winner` + `method` (KO/TKO·Submission·Decision). Cheap tier
  scrapes method from scoreboard `details[]` ("Unofficial Winner …", 'Kotko'
  un-mangled); rich tier upgrades it structurally via `GameSummary.bouts` (core
  per-bout `status.result` + judge scorecards). `decision:'method'` (or `'draw'`).

## 6. Where the data lives (don't assume scoreboard has it)

| Need | Scoreboard | Summary | Core / Web API |
|---|---|---|---|
| scores, status, line scores | ✅ | header (US only) | ✅ |
| soccer penalty shootout | `competitor.shootoutScore` (unverified live) | `gameInfo.*ShootoutScore` | ✅ |
| soccer goal/card events | partial `details[]` | `keyEvents[]` | ✅ full feed |
| box scores / plays | ❌ | ✅ (US sports) | ✅ |
| NFL/CFB drive-by-drive | ❌ | ✅ `drives.previous[]` (VERIFIED 2026-07) | — |
| attendance / officials | `competitions[].attendance` | ✅ `gameInfo` (VERIFIED 2026-07) | — |
| cricket full scorecard | ❌ | ✅ `matchcards[]` (VERIFIED 2026-07 on the SAME site summary) | — |
| tennis match stats | ❌ | ❌ **summary is DEAD for tennis — 400 on every id permutation (2026-07)** | ❌ (also 400/404) |
| MMA method of victory | `details[]` text scrape | ❌ **site summary 404s for ALL MMA events (2026-07)** | ✅ `status.result` per bout |
| MMA judge scorecards | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ competitor `linescores` per bout |
| MMA round length | `{periods}` only | — | ✅ `format.clock` |
| golf playoff flag | — | — | ✅ `status.hadPlayoff` |
| golf cut/major/rounds (`meta.golf`) | ❌ (no `tournament` object) | — | ✅ event → `tournament.$ref` → `tournaments/{id}/seasons/{yyyy}` (VERIFIED 2026-07) |
| golf hole-by-hole + tee times | per-hole values only (no par/scoreType) | — | ✅ web `leaderboard/{event}/playersummary` (VERIFIED 2026-07) |
| tennis/UFC rankings | ❌ | — | ✅ **site** `.../rankings` (same endpoint as college polls; athlete-shaped) |
| standings (incl. racing) | ❌ (stub) | — | ✅ **`apis/v2/.../standings`** — F1/NASCAR entries are ATHLETE-shaped |

> **Trap:** `apis/site/v2/.../standings` returns only a `{fullViewLink}` stub.
> Real standings live at `apis/v2/...` (note: not `site`). Easy to mistake for empty.
>
> **Trap (2026-07):** omit `?season=` and ESPN returns the CURRENT season — which
> is what you want. Passing `getFullYear()` is WRONG mid-year for cross-year
> leagues (in July 2026 the NHL current season is `2027`). The worker now only
> forwards an explicit client `?season=`.
>
> **Trap:** core `$ref` URLs sometimes point at `sports.core.api.espn.pvt` —
> rewrite `.pvt` → `.com` before following (worker/src/espn.js does).

## 8. Worker normalization pipeline

```
fetch raw  ──►  pick family normalizer (by espnPath)  ──►  resolve league profile
   │                                                              │
   └── shared: statusToPhase(), periodLabel(profile, period), parseScore(scoreKind)
                                                                  │
   ◄── emit ScoresResponse (canonical) ◄── per-family: decision, decorations, events, meta
```

- **Shared** across all families: status→phase, period→label (via profile
  `periodMap`/`unit`), competitor identity, score parse by `scoreKind`,
  `anyLive` rollup, HTTPS-forcing logos.
- **Per family** (~10 small functions): how `decision` is computed, which
  decorations to attach (shootout/aggregate/method/cut), event-timeline mapping,
  and second fetches when needed (soccer pens, MMA method → `summary`/core).
- Profiles drive the rest, so a new league = JSON only.

---

## 9. Verification status (be honest about gaps)

`league-profiles.json` marks `"verifiedIds": false` on everything not confirmed
against the live API. Outstanding before relying on them:

- **League ids — RESOLVED** (fetched live 2026-06-13): Serie A `730`, Ligue 1
  `710`, Europa `776`, NFL `28` (uid `s:20~l:28`), NHL `90` / men's-college `91`
  / women's-college `92`, UFC `3321` / PFL `3347` / Bellator `3323`. Every
  concrete league now carries a verified id; only the dynamic buckets
  (`soccer/_other`, `cricket/_tours`) read their id from JSON at runtime.
- **Unverified-vs-live shapes** (re-fetch when in season): NFL regular-season
  tie; CFL live `situation` (`?dates=` returns stale 2023 data — needs core API);
  NHL playoff multi-OT period numbering; live in-progress detail strings for
  tennis/racing/MMA (none were live at capture); cricket Test 4-innings & super
  over; hockey `plays[]` type-id taxonomy (do NOT assert 506-509).
- **2026-07 re-checks pending:** soccer shootout source (scoreboard
  `competitor.shootoutScore` vs summary `gameInfo.*ShootoutScore` — no shootout
  occurred in the probe window; verify at the next WC/cup knockout decided on
  pens); LIV 54-hole/Teamstroke live shape (scoreboard verified, event was
  pre-start); MMA judge-linescores official names (officials are `$ref`s — we
  ship totals only); NCAAW `/rankings` availability (docs matrix says absent,
  route will just return empty polls).
- **Team surfaces — RESOLVED** (probed live 2026-07-06, see §10b): `/teams/{id}/
  roster` (two shapes), `/teams/{id}/statistics` (current-season default; EPL
  empty in offseason), `schedule.team.standingSummary`. Dead end confirmed:
  `common/v3 .../statistics` 404s.
- **Known-unsupported:** boxing (no ESPN sport — source elsewhere); tennis match
  stats (every summary/statistics endpoint 400s — VERIFIED 2026-07, see §6).

These are *data* gaps, not *design* gaps — the contract already models all of
them; the registry just needs the confirmed values filled in.

## 10. 2026-06 additions (data we now surface)

New canonical fields — all **additive** (older clients ignore them), all sourced
from payloads we already fetch unless noted. See `canonical.ts` for the authoritative
shapes + inline QUIRKs.

- **`ScoresResponse.calendarDays` / `seasonWindow`** — ESPN's season skeleton from
  `leagues[0].calendar`, **free** (same scoreboard payload; `worker/src/calendar.js`
  is the single home, shared with `overview.js`). QUIRK (verified): density is NOT
  uniform — NBA/NHL/soccer ship a dense one-per-game-day list, but **MLB ships a
  sparse season-boundary calendar** (48 entries: ST start / All-Star break / season
  end). Treat as a hint, never an exhaustive game-day set; the Schedule strip still
  derives precise in-window days from a range fetch.
- **`GameSummary` enrichments** (ride the one `/summary` fetch — zero extra cost):
  `seasonSeries` (H2H), `recentForm` (last-5, newest last), `injuries` (structured;
  comments dropped), `winProbability` (single current/final %, **NBA/NFL/MLB only** —
  NHL/soccer omit it; an ESPN analytic, not a betting line), and `plays` (the FULL
  play-by-play; the detail page shows the condensed `scoringPlays` and expands into
  this).
- **`RankingsResponse`** — new `GET /v1/rankings/{sport}/{league}` (college AP/Coaches/
  CFP). Lazy, 1h TTL, never in the overview fan-out. Distinct from the per-team
  `curatedRank` already on the scoreboard.

Registry expansion (ids fetched live 2026-06-15): **5 new families** (australian-
football, lacrosse, volleyball [set-based], water-polo, field-hockey) + **~198 league
entries** (soccer +112, rugby +22, cricket +14, mma +11, basketball +10, baseball +9,
golf +5, lacrosse +4, hockey/racing/volleyball/water-polo/AFL/field-hockey). Ephemeral
slugs (qualifiers, friendlies, youth, bilateral cricket tours) stay on the
`soccer/_other` / `cricket/_tours` catch-alls. NOTE the overview fan-out cap
(`OVERVIEW_FETCH_CAP=48`) means only the first 48 leagues get a season-pulse in the
unfiltered `/v1/overview`; page by `?sport`/`?priority` to pulse the rest.

## 10a. 2026-07 additions (the docs-audit round)

All **additive**; every claim below was probed against live ESPN 2026-07-05
before implementation (John Deere Classic live, Wimbledon live, World Cup live).

**Cheap tier (scoreboard fields we downloaded and dropped):**
- `Competition.attendance` / `headline` / `conferenceGame` / `wasSuspended` —
  straight passthroughs, emitted only when present.
- `meta.golf` (**GolfMeta implemented at last** — it had been declared in
  canonical.ts with no producer): the scores route enriches golf events from the
  CORE tournament resource (2 extra fetches per golf event, best-effort;
  `{major, scoringSystem, numberOfRounds, currentRound, cutRound, cutScore,
  cutCount}` verified live). Drives the leaderboard cut line + major badge.

**Rich tier (`GameSummary`):**
- `attendance` + `officials[]` — summary `gameInfo` (venue was already surfaced).
- `drives[]` + gridiron `plays` — NFL/CFB finally get play-feed parity: the
  summary's `drives.previous[]` was always there; we flatten its nested plays
  into the standard `plays` feed and ship compact per-drive rows alongside.
- `cricketInnings[]` — the real cricket scorecard (batting + bowling figures per
  innings) from `matchcards[]`, which rides the SAME site summary we always
  fetched (our fixture trimming had hidden it). Partnerships cards dropped.
- `bouts[]` — MMA structured results. The site summary 404s for MMA, so the
  worker builds the rich tier from the core event's per-bout `status` (result
  displayName/short) + per-competitor `linescores` (judge totals, decisions only).

**New endpoint:**
- `GET /v1/scorecard/{sport}/{league}/{eventId}/{playerId}[?season=]` — golf
  hole-by-hole (web `playersummary`): per-hole strokes/par/scoreType, front/back
  splits, live position, and pre-round tee time/group. Lazy (row tap), 60s TTL.

**Rankings generalized:** `rankingsFeed` registry flag ('polls' | 'tour' |
'divisions') → the SAME `/v1/rankings` route now serves ATP/WTA world rankings
(points) and UFC divisional/P4P lists (records, champion flag) — the site
rankings endpoint handles all three; entries carry `team` OR `athlete`.

**Standings:** racing works through the ordinary path (F1 Drivers/Constructors,
NASCAR flat; athlete-shaped entries now normalized). Season default REMOVED —
ESPN's own current-season default is correct where `getFullYear()` was wrong
(NHL in July). `?date=YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD` range fetches verified working on the
scoreboard and pass through `/v1/scores` unchanged.

**Probed and rejected (do not re-attempt without a fresh probe):** tennis match
stats (all endpoints 400), golf MC/WD/DQ labels (no source), site MMA summary
(404 for every event), core racing `rankings` (empty), dedicated golf
leaderboard endpoints (404). Gambling/odds excluded by product decision.

---

## 10b. Team-surface additions (date nav + team pages)

All **additive**; endpoints probed against live ESPN 2026-07-06 before build.

**Long-TTL past days (F1):** `?date=` on `/v1/scores` already passed through and
cached per-URL; a fully-past dated slate is now cached **6h** (`TTL.pastDay`) not
5m, since it's immutable. `pastDatedTtl()` (in `ttl.js`) takes the range END,
compares against **ET-today** (`Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-CA', America/New_York)`),
and is guarded by `anyLive===false` (a suspended game keeps the tight cadence).
Not infinite: SWR + late stat corrections argue for a bound.

**`TeamCardResponse.team.standingSummary`** — `schedule.team.standingSummary`
(VERIFIED 2026-07: `'2nd in AL East'`, a STRING). Was already on the payload
`/v1/team` fetches → the enriched-card season line costs **zero** subrequests.
Absent for national teams.

**New `GET /v1/teamdetail/{sport}/{league}/{teamId}`** (`TeamDetailResponse`) —
the rich team page. 4 subrequests (schedule required + roster/stats/standings
best-effort), coalesced behind a 30m TTL. Probed live 2026-07-06:
- **roster** — `site/v2 .../teams/{id}/roster` works for NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL/EPL/
  college. **Two shapes, discriminated STRUCTURALLY** (never by sport name):
  entries with `items[]` = position-group buckets (NFL offense/defense/
  specialTeam, soccer by position); a flat `athletes[]` = one `'Roster'` group.
- **stats** — `site/v2 .../teams/{id}/statistics` → `results.stats.categories[]`,
  and **defaults to the current season** (no `getFullYear()` trap — unlike
  standings). **EPL returns an empty `results:{}`** in the offseason → stats must
  be omittable (`[]`). Curated per family via registry `teamStatKeys` (mirrors
  `standingsColumns`) → one ordered `'Season'` group; else natural categories,
  capped ~8. `common/v3 .../statistics` **404s — dead, do not use.**
- **standing** — the team's own group plucked from the shared `normalizeStandings`
  output; omitted when the team id isn't found (national team / athlete-shaped
  racing table). Team pages are gated to `competitorKind==='team'` (added to the
  catalog — `hasTeams` is the wrong gate, it's true for F1 constructors).

**`StandingsResponse` gap closed:** the standings shape shipped in
`worker/src/standings.js` + `models.dart` but was undeclared in `canonical.ts`;
now declared retroactively (racing's athlete-shaped rows noted as a QUIRK).

## 11. Versioning, backward-compatibility & app updates

The contract is versioned as a **discipline, not a protocol**. The Flutter client
parses tolerantly (`models.dart`: unknown keys ignored, missing fields defaulted,
every discriminator stored as a pass-through string), so an **already-installed
APK keeps working when the worker adds to a payload** — no coordinated rollout.
`/v1` is therefore a contract *name*, not a build number; it absorbs change
additively, indefinitely.

### The one rule that keeps old apps alive
The worker normalizers may **add** to a payload freely, but must **never reshape an
existing field in place** — new meaning goes in a **new** field.

**Additive (ship anytime on `/v1`, no version bump, no coordination):**
- a new optional field (top-level or nested) on any payload;
- a new enum / discriminator value on a pass-through string (`layout`, `scoreKind`,
  `competitorKind`, `phase`, `decision`, overview `state`, …) — old apps fail the
  `== known` check and fall through to a default render (the "unknown passes
  through, never crash" contract);
- a new league in `league-profiles.json` (pure data → `resolve.mjs` → catalog);
- a new route under `/v1` (old apps never call it);
- dropping an *optional* field (old apps guard with null/`const []`/`''`).

**Breaking (requires minting `/v2`) — the three verified traps the tolerant
parser does NOT catch:**
1. **Type change** of an existing field (e.g. a string score → number/object):
   `_int`/`_num` return null, `_str` returns `''` — the value silently *vanishes*.
2. **Count/order change of positionally-zipped parallel arrays** a renderer indexes
   without bounds-checking — `BoxGroup.columns`↔`BoxRow.stats`,
   `PeriodLines.labels`↔`SidePeriods.values`. These `RangeError` / mis-align at
   *render* time, invisible to both the parser and the update gate.
3. **Renaming a map key** the app indexes by (ESPN stat abbreviations in
   `Competitor.stats` / `StandingsRow.stats`) — old apps silently show nothing.

Litmus: *"would a v0.1.0 APK I can't update throw, mis-align, or silently blank a
value? → breaking, mint `/v2`; else add a field."*

**The machine guard for this human rule:** `app/test/detail_page_test.dart` and
`team_card_test.dart` re-parse **and re-render** the committed `test/fixtures/`
(canonical worker output). A careless reshape of a positionally-zipped grid trips
them in CI. Keep those fixtures; treat a change that forces editing them as a
breaking-change signal.

### Minting `/v2` (deferred — only when a breaking change forces it)
`/v1` and `/v2` do **not** coexist today: `worker/src/index.js` hard-rejects any
prefix that isn't `'v1'`. When forced: change that gate to a small dispatch
(`{v1:1, v2:2}[v]`); add a pure `shapeForMajor(major, canonicalObj)` that projects
the single canonical object down to the v1 wire shape at the final `json()` step
(never fork `resolve.mjs`/the normalizers); flip `Api.apiPrefix` (`app/lib/src/api.dart`)
to `/v2` (one line — every method passes a version-less path). The Cache API keys
off the full URL, so the two majors never collide and one `wrangler deploy` ships
both. **Bias hard toward ten additive fields over one `/v2`.**

### Client version signal (telemetry only)
The app sends `X-Scores-Client: <versionCode> <versionName>` on every request
(`api.dart` `_get`), sourced from compile-time consts (`app/lib/src/version.dart`)
baked by `--dart-define` in `release.yml` — the `CLIENT_VERSION_CODE` is the same
`github.run_number` that becomes the APK's `versionCode`, so reported == installed.
The worker only `console.log`s it (visible in `wrangler tail` / observability); it
is **never** a routing input or a cache-key dimension. A local `flutter run`
reports `0 dev`.

### Update warning (sideloaded APK — signal + link, never force)
There is no Play Store auto-update, so the worker can only advise. The
`/v1/health` response carries an advisory **`client` gate** echoed from the
registry's top-level `client` block (`league-profiles.json`):

```json
"client": {
  "minVersionCode": 0, "recommendedVersionCode": 0,
  "latestVersionName": "0.1.0",
  "downloadUrl": "https://github.com/phil-scott-78/sports-app/releases/latest"
}
```

The app (`updateTierProvider` → `UpdateBanner`) compares its baked `versionCode`:
at/above recommended → nothing; `[min, recommended)` → a dismissible "update
available" nudge (once per release); below `min` → a persistent "no longer
supported" bar. Tapping opens GitHub Releases. **Fail-open is load-bearing:** an
absent `client` block (old worker, a fork, or the offline `npm run mock` server)
parses to a null gate → no banner. `0/0` ships the gate fully inert. Internal
`_`-prefixed keys (e.g. `_doc`) are stripped on the wire (`worker/src/client.js`).

### Release ritual (automated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`)
Tag and push `vX.Y.Z` (`git tag v0.3.1 && git push origin v0.3.1`). The workflow runs
two jobs in order:
1. **`build`** — builds + publishes the signed APK to GitHub Releases (`versionName`
   = the tag, `versionCode` = `github.run_number`; the SAME run number is baked into
   the app via `--dart-define`, so what the app reports == what's installed).
2. **`deploy-worker`** (`needs: build` — runs only after the Release is live) — runs
   the offline worker tests, then **injects `recommendedVersionCode = run_number` and
   `latestVersionName = tag`** into the bundled registry and `wrangler deploy`s. The
   injection is ephemeral (CI's checkout only) — it is **not** committed.

One tag ships both halves in the right order, no manual gate edit. Because the
advertised `recommendedVersionCode` equals the APK's `versionCode`, the just-shipped
build never nags itself and every older install gets the soft "update available".
**`minVersionCode` is never auto-bumped** — retiring an old build (the persistent
banner) is a deliberate commit to `league-profiles.json`. The committed
`recommendedVersionCode` is only the baseline a manual `wrangler deploy` would use.

Required repo secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" token
template, scoped to the `philco.dev` zone) + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, alongside the
APK signing secrets (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`).

### Origin (effectively irreversible once an APK ships)
The app's baked default origin is a **stable custom domain**
(`api.scores.philco.dev`, `config.dart`), deliberately not the `*.workers.dev`
name — a sideloaded APK can't be force-migrated, so renaming the origin would
orphan every install. Point the domain at the worker (uncomment the
`custom_domain` route in `worker/wrangler.toml`) before the first release tag.
